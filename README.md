# ThinkactriseInternship
I'm Ansh Kaushik a 3rd-year B.Tech student, and this is my submission for the internship task. I built a simple Flask web app that fetches Indian court case details using Selenium. The user selects a case type and number, and the app retrieves relevant case metadata from the official eCourts site.
# 🏛️ Court Case Info Fetcher – Indian eCourts Web App

This is a simple web app built using **Flask** and **Selenium** that lets you search for basic case details from Indian District Courts.  
The idea is to enter a case type and number, and it fetches the latest metadata and order info (if available) from the official [ecourts](https://services.ecourts.gov.in) website.
